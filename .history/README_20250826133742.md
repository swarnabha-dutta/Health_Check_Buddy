## ⚙️ **Platform Workflow**

### 1. **Landing & Navigation**

- Users arrive at the homepage and can easily navigate to the pricing page.
- The pricing page (`app/(main)/pricing/page.jsx`) features transparent consultation packages, FAQs, and a direct contact form.

### 2. **Transparent Pricing**

- Pricing tables are rendered via modular components in `components/pricing/`.
- Each package is clearly described—no hidden fees, no surprises.

### 3. **Contact & Support**

- Users can reach out through the contact form (`components/ui/ContactForm.jsx`), available on both pricing and contact pages.
- Submissions are processed and can be integrated with backend support workflows.

### 4. **Database & Backend**

- All user and consultation data is managed with Prisma ORM, with schemas defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Neon provides a scalable, serverless Postgres backend.
- Next.js and Node.js handle API routes and data fetching.

### 5. **Modern UI & Styling**
